This is a Git repository for a WSGI calculator.

Run calculator.py and then open a browser and open the following url:
localhost:8088 *

**Please note, the site is 8088, NOT 8080.  For some reason my computer think 8080 is already
in use so I haven't been using that for my testing.** 

From there the website will give you information on how to run the application.
